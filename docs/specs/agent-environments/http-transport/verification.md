# Verification

Verified base: 18aa9af2b2c26fd114113dd39528a91224801840 (fetched main).

The worktree was moved onto that base with the slice's changes kept
uncommitted, then reinstalled with `npm ci` (exit 0; 540 packages added, 541
audited; 6.56 s elapsed, 3.85 s user, 8.07 s sys, 881459200 bytes maximum
resident set size). After the edits of this pass the tree was rebuilt with
`npm run build` (exit 0, three turbo tasks; 5.23 s elapsed, 13.94 s user,
2.93 s sys, 2964652032 bytes) and `npm run test:prepare` (exit 0, six tasks
with three cache hits; 1.37 s elapsed, 3.07 s user, 0.76 s sys, 422625280
bytes); `dist/mcp/` carries the rebuilt `serveStreamableHttp-*.js` chunk beside
`main.js`.

Static gates on the final tree: `npm run check:fast` passed (typecheck and
lint, two tasks; 4.69 s elapsed, 24.25 s user, 3.00 s sys, 4480139264 bytes).
`npx oxlint` over the files touched in this pass reported no findings. After
the last edit, including this record, `npm run format` ran over 4032 files
(0.68 s elapsed, 4.11 s user, 0.74 s sys, 227393536 bytes) and `npm run
format:check` passed (0.69 s elapsed, 4.09 s user, 0.62 s sys, 216989696
bytes). `npx knip` exited 0 (3.80 s elapsed, 5.10 s user, 0.72 s sys,
868679680 bytes). `npm run check:ci:tasks` passed all eight tasks, seven of
them turbo cache hits from the run on the same sources (0.88 s elapsed, 4.52 s
user, 1.04 s sys, 215171072 bytes): jscpd reported 2576 clones and 3.35%
duplicated lines across 3143 files under the 3.5% threshold, lint:built 0
errors over 3734 files, and format:check ran fresh. `npm run docs:check`
passed, including the README consistency test (5 cases; 3.27 s elapsed,
3.43 s user, 0.80 s sys, 288866304 bytes). `git diff --stat` lists 13 tracked
files, none under `src/domain/`.

Source-group tests: `/usr/bin/time -l npx vitest run --project adapters
src/server/http src/server/shutdownRegistration.test.ts` passed 3 files, 17
tests in 2.74 s elapsed, 3.12 s user, 0.93 s sys, 289767424 bytes.
`serveStreamableHttp.test.ts` gained the concurrent case: a slot with one open
session receives two `initialize` requests through `Promise.all`, exactly one
answers `200` with a session id and the other `400`, the instance's `onclose`
hook has fired zero times, and `slot.close()` fires it once. Run before the fix
against the same file, that case failed with the hook count `0` instead of `1`
(1 failed, 5 passed; 1.07 s elapsed, 0.84 s user, 0.21 s sys, 158187520
bytes), which is the pinned no-op hook the review described.
`shutdownRegistration.test.ts` asserts that `registerProcessShutdown` hands
the handler `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` by name and `undefined` for stdin end, that
omitting stdin registers no input listener, and that `registerSignalShutdown`
reports `143`/`130`.

Built-group tests ran after `npm run test:prepare`. The targeted dispatcher
run, `/usr/bin/time -l npx vitest run --project cli-boundary
tests/boundary/cli/dispatcher.test.ts`, passed 3 tests in 1.08 s elapsed,
0.89 s user, 0.26 s sys, 153026560 bytes, now including `mcp add --http`
routed to the CLI beside `mcp --http --port 0`, `--mcp --http` and `mcp --host
127.0.0.1 --http` routed to the HTTP entry and `mcp doctor --http`, `mcp add`
and `--mcp extra` keeping their routes.

The four full projects ran in sequence while a sibling worktree ran its own
`cli-boundary`, `mcp-boundary` and `acceptance` chain on the same host.
`/usr/bin/time -l npx vitest run --project adapters` passed 247 files, 3945
tests with 8 skipped, in 93.77 s elapsed, 80.21 s user, 30.69 s sys, 344260608
bytes. `/usr/bin/time -l npx vitest run --project mcp-boundary` passed 155
files with 2 skipped, 910 tests with 7 skipped, in 167.51 s elapsed, 321.24 s
user, 51.30 s sys, 4923490304 bytes (the Vitest parent, its workers and the
spawned CLI children). `/usr/bin/time -l npx vitest run --project
process-boundary` exited 1: 56 files passed, 2 skipped and 2 failed, 460 tests
passed, 19 skipped and 7 failed, in 544.81 s elapsed, 160.89 s user, 133.49 s
sys, 1028931584 bytes. `/usr/bin/time -l npx vitest run --project
cli-boundary` exited 1: 108 files passed and 3 failed, 658 tests passed, 2
skipped and 7 failed, in 452.34 s elapsed, 734.29 s user, 234.02 s sys,
648495104 bytes. No failing file belongs to this slice.

The failures split into two kinds. Load: six `jadxIntegration.test.ts` cases
hit the 30 s test or 10 s hook timeout, and six `javascriptApplication*.test.ts`
cases failed with the worker's result-capacity constraint; re-run alone in this
worktree after the other chains ended, `jadxIntegration.test.ts` passed all 48
tests and both JavaScript files passed all 20 tests (`cli-boundary` three files:
20 passed, 1 failed, 23.38 s elapsed, 32.99 s user, 10.97 s sys, 343244800
bytes; `process-boundary` two files: 48 passed, 1 failed, 62.48 s elapsed,
21.89 s user, 17.55 s sys, 686620672 bytes). Pre-existing on main in this
environment: `closedStdout.test.ts` "stops quietly when the reader closes
during streamed JSON" exits `1` instead of `141` with 1009 bytes received and
empty stderr, and `releaseArtifactCanary.test.ts` fails parsing `npm pack
--json`, which npm 12.0.2 emits as an object keyed by package name rather than
the tuple the test expects. Both reproduce identically on the clean sibling
clone at `52b73ee857029a3ab8f5c6eeef233b295951a46c` (no tracked or untracked
changes; `closedStdout` 1 failed, 3 passed, 8.86 s elapsed, 6.98 s user, 2.29 s
sys, 348012544 bytes; the canary 1 failed, 7.91 s elapsed, 7.76 s user, 1.84 s
sys, 668729344 bytes). That clone predates the verified base by 15 commits,
none touching either test or `scripts/rea.mjs`. Because the dispatcher is on
the `closedStdout` path, its scenario was also replayed against this
worktree's built `dist/` with the `18aa9af2` `scripts/rea.mjs` and with the
edited one, three runs each: all six exited `1` with 1009 bytes received and
empty stderr. Nothing in this pass was changed for these failures.

Cross-implementation check with the Python `mcp` 1.30.0 client (httpx 0.28.1,
Python 3.12.12) against the built `node scripts/rea.mjs mcp --http --port 0 <
/dev/null`: stderr announced
`{"transport":"streamable-http","url":"http://127.0.0.1:57093/mcp","msg":"MCP transport listening"}`.
Session A: `initialize` POST returned `200 text/event-stream` with
`mcp-session-id`; `notifications/initialized` returned `202` with no body; the
standalone GET and the `tools/list` and `tools/call` POSTs returned `200
text/event-stream`; `tools/list` reported 207 tools including
`binary_session`; `binary_session` with `{}` returned `isError=False`; `DELETE
/mcp` returned `200`. Session B, opened after that `DELETE`, initialized with a
new session id, listed the same 207 tools, and `binary_session` again returned
`isError=False` before its own `DELETE` returned `200`. The server logged two
`MCP HTTP session opened` and two `MCP HTTP session closed by the client`
lines, SIGTERM then exited it with status `143`, and stdout stayed empty. The
methods, statuses and session-id handling of session A match the recorded
reference exchange step for step; the reference's echo server labelled its
`202` and `DELETE` replies `application/json`, where this listener sends no
content type for those bodiless replies.

## Independent review

An adversarial review of the first implementation reproduced that, after a
`DELETE`, the next session could initialize and list tools but every tool call
failed with a `cancelled` error because the SDK's `DELETE` handling closed the
transport and the server's `onclose` hooks ran provider teardown. It also found
that a session ended without `DELETE` blocked the listener until restart, that
the bind-failure log line omitted the system cause, a duplicated foreign-`Host`
probe, a missing trailing newline on `rea mcp --http --help`, and a static
import of the HTTP listener on the stdio path. Each finding is addressed and
covered by the adapters, mcp-boundary and Python checks in this document.

The re-review of the rebased tree raised four points, all resolved here. Two
concurrent `initialize` POSTs could leave the no-op `onclose` hook installed,
because each session end captured the hook current at that moment and the
later `finally` restored the other call's no-op; `McpSessionSlot` now captures
the instance's hook once, after the factory returns the fully wrapped server,
and every session end restores exactly that, with the adapters case above
failing before and passing after the change. The optional stdin parameter of
`registerProcessShutdown` was dead in production; `registerSignalShutdown` is
now a projection of `registerProcessShutdown(handler, { signals })`, so one
primitive owns registration while the handler learns the signal and keeps
`130`/`143`. The dispatcher routed any `mcp` invocation containing `--http` to
the HTTP entry; it now does so only when the first token after `mcp` or
`--mcp` is a flag, so `rea mcp add --http` keeps the CLI's own diagnostic, and
the dispatcher test covers that case. The formatter hunk in
`src/domain/propertyListXml.test.ts` noted in the earlier record is gone after
the rebase, as `git diff --stat` confirms. The replacement rule stays as
documented, and `docs/mcp-contracts.md` now states it in one sentence with its
rationale so maintainers can decide on it.

## Scope and measurement limits

The concurrent-`initialize` case is exercised at the slot with in-memory
`Request` objects, where both calls advance in lockstep; over TCP two
connections are served in separate event-loop turns, so the race is reachable
only in-process and the listener-level behaviour remains "the newest client
owns the server, the other sees `400` or `404`". The non-loopback relaxation
path is covered only through the pure allowlist helper and the loopback smoke
runs; no wide bind was exercised. Sessions are served one at a time;
concurrent clients are not supported. The two failures that reproduce on the
clean clone are environmental (macOS with Node 22.23.1 and npm 12.0.2) and are
left for their owners; the load-induced timeouts were classified by isolated
re-runs, not by repeating the full projects on an idle host. The error-level
log line that names the bind cause was observed in earlier runs, not asserted
by `mainErrors.test.ts`. Response budgets keep the stdio-derived floor and were
not re-measured over HTTP. Windows was not run.
